Q1: So you're finishing up your time in this CSCC program. Why did you decide to embark on this journey?

 * _Mark_: Originally started JAVA courses in 2014 

Q2: I love to travel. Tell me a bit about your favorite travel destination so far. What's on your travel bucket list?

 * _Mark_: St. John U.S. Virgin Islands was awesome.  I want to go to space.  Especially the Moon.  Dreamed of it my whole life.

Q3: Name your favorite member of The Beatles, and your favorite Beatles song. You do know at least one Beatles song, right? If you are a Beatles fan, feel free to give me your top 5 or so.

 * _Mark_: Ringo. Seemed like he always having the most fun.  My song is Help!  Everything they did great is in there.

Q4: Do you have any pets? Species/Name/Details please. Murray wants to know... (he's not as smart as that picture makes him seem).

 * _Mark_: I have two dogs. Pandie is 1/2 Newfoundland and 1/2 Bernese Mountain. A 6 y.o. female and the sweetest monster around.  Polly (Woggy) is 1 1/2 years female pointer type.  We rescued her from a Moscow kill shelter through a Nationwide employee.  She loves the heat and can't get enough of it.  Goes bonkers under the dryer vent!
